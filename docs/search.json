It presents its name, country, number of valid\r\nvotes and registered turnout percentage. The second chunk then arranged\r\nthe dataset into the inverse, presenting the top 5 constituencies in\r\nterms of highest number of valid votes.\r\nThis is important to show as it gives us a better idea of where\r\ngreater voter inequality might be taking place. It gives us an idea of\r\nwhere the smallest constituencies whilst also presenting how low turnout\r\ncan get in those areas.\r\nThe Following is a Data Visualisation example:\r\nggplot(uk, aes(x = country, y = valid_votes, fill = country)) +\r\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\r\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"Distribution of Constituency Sizes by Country\",\r\n    y = \"Valid Votes\",\r\n    x = \"Country\",\r\n    fill = \"Country\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  theme_minimal() \r\n\r\nThis data visualisation shows the distribution of constituency sizes\r\nby country within the UK. I use the ggplot function to create a\r\nvisualisation of the previously created uk data set, opting to use a\r\nboxplot. The boxplot is used as it shows the median, interquartile range\r\nas well as outliers best. I then used scale_y_continuous and\r\nlabels=scale::comma to format and modify the y-axis to better the data,\r\nwith all values coming within a very particular range. I then set the\r\ncolour palette to better present the data and labelled each axis and\r\ntitled the visualisation.\r\nThe resulting visualisation I believe creates a good clear\r\nrepresentation of the data. It shows that Northern Ireland has the most\r\nequal-sized constituencies, that Scotland has two major outliers but\r\nwithout them it is England that has the far most inequality in terms of\r\nconstituency size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
