It presents its name, country, number of valid votes and registered\r\nturnout percentage. The second chunk then arranged the dataset into the inverse,\r\npresenting the top 5 constituencies in terms of highest number of valid votes.\r\nThis is important to show as it gives us a better idea of where greater voter\r\ninequality might be taking place. It gives us an idea of where the smallest\r\nconstituencies whilst also presenting how low turnout can get in those areas.\r\nThe Following is a Data Visualisation example:\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(uk, aes(x = country, y = valid_votes, fill = country)) +\r\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\r\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"Distribution of Constituency Sizes by Country\",\r\n    y = \"Valid Votes\",\r\n    x = \"Country\",\r\n    fill = \"Country\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  theme_minimal() \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis data visualisation shows the distribution of constituency sizes by country\r\nwithin the UK. I use the ggplot function to create a visualisation of the\r\npreviously created uk data set, opting to use a boxplot. The boxplot is used as\r\nit shows the median, interquartile range as well as outliers best. I then used\r\nscale_y_continuous and labels=scale::comma to format and modify the y-axis to\r\nbetter the data, with all values coming within a very particular range. I then\r\nset the colour palette to better present the data and labelled each axis and\r\ntitled the visualisation.\r\nThe resulting visualisation I believe creates a good clear representation of the\r\ndata. It shows that Northern Ireland has the most equal-sized constituencies,\r\nthat Scotland has two major outliers but without them it is England that has the\r\nfar most inequality in terms of constituency size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
